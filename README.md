Abstract:
Discretization and feature selection are two basic preprocessing stages of data mining. However, it often results in information loss due to these two separate stages. This paper proposes a novel supervised multivariate discretizer integrated with feature selection, called D-FS. It takes into consideration of the interactions of both different cut-points and features, and achieves feature selection by discretization. D-FS can avoid the information loss caused by the independence of discretization and feature selection. Compared with several state-of-the-art discretizers, D-FS retains a smaller subset of both cut-points and features, while achieves competitive classification performance combined with different classifiers.
